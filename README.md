# Call Manager

Call Manager is a cross-platform application for scheduling and keeping track of phone calls. Think of it as a "to-do" list, dedicated to phone calls.

Features:
- Add phone calls to your list as Call Cards. Call Cards have one-tap actions for accomplishing tasks for that call, like:
	- Call
	- Send SMS
	- Edit Call
	- Set Notification Reminder
	- Delete Call
- Clean, simple interface
- Light/dark/system themes

Call Manager is available on the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store. It is compatible with Apple Silicon, and a dedicated macOS version will be coming later this year. You can also download the app right from the Releases section of this repository.
